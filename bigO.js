// Dog search
// 1) The Big O for the first scenario would be Constant Time 0(1), since no matter how many dogs are
// in the room, it will take the same amount of time to find a dog of the same breed as mine if I just
// yell my question out to everyone.

// 2) The Big O for the second scenario would be Linear Time O(n), since run times are directly proportional
// to the size of the input. If there are 5 dogs, it will take that long to ask each owner what breed the
// dog is, if there are 100 dogs, it will take that long to ask each owner about the breed.

// Even or Odd
// Testing a number for even or odd would be Linear Time, it is directly proportional to
// the size of the input.

// Are You Here
// This algorithm requires 2 levels of looping over an input, so this would be Polynomial Time

// Doubler
// This algorithm is doubling ever number in an array, so this would be Linear Time,
// the running time is directly proportional to the size of the input

// Naive Search
// This algorithm is checking if each element in an array matches another input, so
// this would be Linear Time, running time is directly proportional to the size of the input

// Create pairs
// This algorithm is taking one array, going through each element and then going through each
// element of the same array again and pairing each element, these are nested loops, so
// this would be Polynomial Time.

// Compute the Sequence
// Ask for help on this one

// An Efficient Search
// Ask for help on this one

// Random Element
// This algorithm is finding a random number in an array, so it would be Constant Time. The algorithm
// will take the same amount of time no matter the size of the input.

// What Am I
// I think this is testing numbers to see if they are a prime number or a even number, if they are not,
// it returns true. I think this would be Linear Time, running time would be directly proportional to the
// input size.
