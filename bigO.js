// Dog search
// 1) The Big O for the first scenario would be Constant Time 0(1), since no matter how many dogs are
// in the room, it will take the same amount of time to find a dog of the same breed as mine if I just
// yell my question out to everyone.

// 2) The Big O for the second scenario would be Linear Time O(n), since run times are directly proportional
// to the size of the input. If there are 5 dogs, it will take that long to ask each owner what breed the
// dog is, if there are 100 dogs, it will take that long to ask each owner about the breed.
